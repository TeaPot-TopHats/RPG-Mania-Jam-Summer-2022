This is the second game we made as team TeaPot TopHats for the RPG Mania Jam in the Summer of 2022 with Unity. In the game you play as a cat and try to defeat a slime boss at the end. This is actually completely different from what we envisioned, we even had a writer on the team to try and make an official script but in the last days of development we realized that major cuts had to be made. With that said we are still happy to release this as our second entry and hope to make more.
